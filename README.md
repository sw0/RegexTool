# RegexTool
# Introduction
RegexTool is a small tool that uses for process text content by Regular Expressions.
It's built long time ago and old :). I used it as daily work to:
## Test Regular Expressions
## Use templates to generate the content base on the template

If you like, you can download or refine the code. Thanks.
